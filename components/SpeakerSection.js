            This will be a formal invitation for individuals or organizations to
            submit proposals to speak at the Pycon Uganda conference. It allows
            conference organizers to identify a diverse range of potential
            speakers with unique perspectives and experiences. This will help to
            ensure that the conference features a well-rounded program that is
            engaging and relevant to attendees. This will also be crucial in
            promoting diversity and inclusion in the conference program and
            encourage the sharing of new ideas and approaches.
